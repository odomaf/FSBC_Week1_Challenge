# Challenge: WanderNote ‚Äî Convert Divs to Semantic HTML

## Objective
You are given a **div-heavy** 2010s-style page. Convert it into a clean, accessible, **semantic HTML** layout
while **preserving the visual design** (CSS already targets ids/classes so your semantic swap won't break).

## Tasks
1. Open `Unsolved/index.html` and **replace structural `<div>` elements** with semantic tags:
   - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
2. Keep class/id names the same so existing CSS continues to work.
3. Add meaningful `alt` text to images and accessible link text.
4. Ensure headings follow a logical order (e.g., one `<h1>`, then `<h2>` for sections).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Visual layout remains intact.
- Semantic elements used appropriately.
- All images have meaningful `alt` attributes.
- Headings are logical and accessible.

> **Note:** Plain selectors only this week. No pseudo-classes required.
